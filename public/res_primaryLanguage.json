    "description": "ðŸ‘‹ My name is Brandon Wolf. I am a Navy Veteran of 5 years as an avionics Electronics Technician. I did one deployment on the USS Harry S Truman where I led a team of 10 sailors to the repair of 422 aviation items. After the military, I attended Microsoft Software and System academy where I learned how to be a cloud administrator on Azure. It was during that class I learned the use of backend development and I enrolled in Code Fellows Coding Bootcamp to expand my knowledge. I am learning HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Python. I have a growth mindset and I am not attached to any one place!  ",
